# LISP

The purpose of this assignment is for you to gain some experience designing and implementing
LISP programs. This assignment explores only a few of the many interesting LISP features.
This assignment is broken into several parts. The first part is a fairly straightforward LISP
warmup. The second part continues the warmup. The third part involves writing your own version
of the standard LISP function every; the remaining parts will use your function. The fourth
part illustrates the standard technique of car-cdr recursion. The remaining parts involve writing
functions that rewrite LISP expressions. More specifically, these parts takes as input a LISP
expression and produces as output another, possibly different LISP expression. The modified
expression will be semantically equivalent to the original, but it will use if’s rather than cond’s.
